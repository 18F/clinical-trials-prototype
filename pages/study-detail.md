    <p>In layperson's language state the purpose of the study in 3-5 sentences.</p>
    <p>Previous research has demonstrated that intimate partners can positively influence those with PTSD to seek treatment. The investigators have preliminary evidence to demonstrate that mobile apps, such as PTSD Coach can be helpful for those with PTSD, and the current study will provide Veterans with PTSD and their partners with a mobile app designed to promote engagement with evidence-based treatments for PTSD. The purpose of this PILOT study is to evaluate methods for delivering a couples-based intervention to reduce PTSD symptoms and improve relationship quality in Veterans and their intimate partners.</p>
    <p>b) State what the Investigator(s) hope to learn from the study. Include an assessment of the importance of this new knowledge.</p>
    <p>Understanding ways to improve the public health impact of public-facing, evidence-based mobile apps is critical. This study will test a low-cost, "high-touch" approach to improving the outcomes associated with use of the PTSD Coach and PTSD Family Coach mobile apps,which are already available to the general public and used by over 55,000 new users per year.This study will test whether the involvement of an intimate partner in the use of a mobile app for PTSD will result in changes in how the mobile apps are used and in relationship quality and PTSD symptoms over time. Additionally, this study will test whether the addition of a discussion board can improve engagement with the apps and/or outcomes. The study will also provide useful qualitative data that can inform the development of subsequent dyadic interventions using mobile technologies.</p>
    <p>c) Explain why human subjects must be used for this project. (i.e. purpose of study is to test efficacy of investigational device in individuals with specific condition; purpose of study is to examine specific behavioral traits in humans in classroom or other environment)</p>
    <p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate how Veterans and their partners interact with evidence-based mobile apps for improving PTSD symptoms.</p>
    <h3 id="whats-being-tested">What’s being tested</h3>
    <p>In interventional studies, participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. Arm refers to each group or subgroup of participants in a clinical trial that receives specfic interventions (or no intervention) according to the study protocol.</p>
